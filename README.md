# logbook
What I use daily to write some journals.

This project is yet to be functional.

Some keyfeatures explained. You store your journals locally, you can only write one per day. 
There is a feature to retrieve, organize and read the files that I am implementing.

I also might implement some sort of file crypting/hashing - master password in the future, and a
backup save feature aswell.
