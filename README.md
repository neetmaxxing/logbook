# logbook
What I use daily to write some journals.

This project is yet to be functional.

Some keyfeatures explained : You store your journals locally, you can only write one per day. 
There is a feature to retrieve, organize and read the files that I am implementing.
-------------------------------------
#bugs to fix
* Your files are not hashed/password protected, anyone with access to your computer can read them
* You have to run the script manually-- rather than it being a cli command to simply type, meaning there needs to be that implementation + man page argparse / commands
* There is no backup feature whatsoever. If your files dissapear, they are gone forever
* There is no log of what the user did- you do not know what actions have been performed to your files in case someone modified/read them
